        <h2>Counting Sort</h2>

        <p>
            Counting Sort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm. It works by
            counting how many times each element appears in the input array.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead of comparing elements, the algorithm creates a count array to
            store the frequency of each value. Using this frequency data, elements
            are placed directly into their correct sorted positions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Counting Sort performs very efficiently when the range of input values
            is small. Its time complexity is O(n + k), where n is the number of
            elements and k is the range of values.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, Counting Sort is not suitable for large ranges because it
            requires extra memory. It is mainly used when data values are
            non-negative integers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Example: For the input array <strong>[4, 2, 2, 8, 3]</strong>, the
            algorithm counts occurrences and reconstructs the sorted array as
            <strong>[2, 2, 3, 4, 8]</strong>.
